Vaping is the safest alternative to smoking traditional cigarettes,"Evidence from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and Johns Hopkins Medicine suggests that vaping is not entirely safe. Nicotine, found in most e-cigarettes, is a highly addictive drug that can lead to addiction. Vaping exposes the lungs to various chemicals, some of which are known carcinogens and toxic substances. There have been reports of serious lung illnesses and deaths associated with vaping. Furthermore, there is no conclusive scientific evidence that vaping aids in long-term smoking cessation. Research from Johns Hopkins University reveals thousands of unidentified chemical ingredients in vape products, including potentially harmful substances. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed cases of lung injury and deaths attributed to vaping. Lastly, a study found that most people who intended to use e-cigarettes to quit smoking ended up continuing to smoke both traditional and e-cigarettes.","https://nida.nih.gov/publications/drugfacts/vaping-devices-electronic-cigarettes

Vaping doesn't contain nicotine,"Evidence from Johns Hopkins Medicine indicates that e-cigarettes heat nicotine, flavorings, and other chemicals to create an aerosol that users inhale. This nicotine is extracted from tobacco and is a primary agent in both regular cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Users of e-cigarettes can even get more nicotine than they would from a combustible tobacco product, as they can buy extra-strength cartridges or increase the e-cigarette’s voltage. Similarly, Harvard Health Publishing states that the amount of nicotine in many vaping products is much higher than in regular cigarettes. The CDC also confirms that most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, with a study finding that 99% of e-cigarettes sold in the U.S. contained nicotine.","https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/5-truths-you-need-to-know-about-vaping

Diacetyl in vape juice is harmless,"Diacetyl, a chemical found in vape juice, is linked to lung disease, according to the CDC. A 2012 study found that harmful effects from e-liquids were due to flavoring chemicals, not nicotine, suggesting diacetyl could contribute to these effects. Heating and vaporizing these chemicals, including diacetyl, makes them particularly toxic to lung cells. The safety of vaping is still under research, indicating potential unknown long-term risks. Furthermore, diacetyl has been associated with severe obstructive lung disease, known as ""popcorn lung,"" and can cause irreversible lung damage. Lastly, diacetyl was found in many e-cigarette flavorings, which are linked to severe respiratory diseases.","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326489

Vaping decreases the risks of developing asthma and COPD.,"Evidence from Harvard Health Publishing suggests that vaping may increase the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and COPD. The vapors from e-cigarettes contain harmful substances like cancer-causing toxins, metals, and lung irritants. Furthermore, a condition called EVALI, linked to vaping, has resulted in extensive lung damage and even death. Secondhand exposure to e-cigarette vapors can also trigger asthma. Nicotine, a common ingredient in vaping products, can exacerbate conditions like COPD. Similarly, a study from the University of California in San Francisco found that both current and former e-cigarette users had a higher risk of developing chronic lung disease.","https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-vaping-help-you-quit-smoking-2019022716086

"Among traditional smokers, the study found no increase in the odds of developing COPD.","Tobacco use, including traditional smoking, is one of the biggest public health threats, causing over 8 million deaths annually worldwide, with more than 7 million resulting from direct use. It is widely known that COPD is a leading cause of death among smokers. All forms of tobacco use are harmful and there is no safe level of exposure, implying even moderate smoking can increase the risk of COPD. Studies such as ""Mortality in relation to smoking: 50 years' observations on male British doctors"" and ""Tobacco smoking and all-cause mortality in a large Australian cohort study"" provide evidence of smoking's harmful effects, including an increased risk of COPD. Furthermore, the National Institute on Drug Abuse links smoking to severe health issues including COPD. The Surgeon General's report on Women and Smoking also states that cigarette smoking is a primary cause of COPD among women, with the risk increasing with the amount and duration of smoking.","https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco
