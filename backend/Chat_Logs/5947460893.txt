Unlike other antiseptics and antibiotics, pathogens (harmful germs) do not seem to develop resistance to alcohol-based sanitizers.  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters#sanitizer

PersuasiveHealthBot,2023-04-28 16:06:44,The COVID survivors, especially those who'd needed ventilators, logged far slower mental processing speeds and showed less-accurate verbal reasoning than the uninfected group. The researchers estimated their magnitude of cognitive loss to be about 10 IQ points. https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/severe-covid-infection-may-lead-to-noticeable-cognitive-loss
